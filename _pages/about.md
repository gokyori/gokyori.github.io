Hello! I'm Rabin Banjade, PhD candidate at the University of Memphis, where I explore natural language processing to improve computer science education. Under the guidance of Dr. Vasile Rus, I navigate the intriguing intersection of these fields, focusing on creating innovative teaching methods for computer programming.

My primary goal revolves around developing approaches tailored to enhance the learning and teaching experiences in computer programming. Recently, my focus has been on harnessing the power of large language models to craft intelligent tutoring systems geared towards programming education. I'm keen on leveraging these advancements to make learning programming more effective, engaging, and accessible.

My academic journey has seen me delve into various facets of NLP, including keyphrase extraction, question generation, and exploring semantic similarities. These experiences have honed my skills and deepened my understanding of how language and programming intertwine.

I'm always open to suggestions, feedback, or even a friendly chat! Whether you're intrigued by my work, have ideas to share, or simply want to discuss shared interests, feel free to reach out. Beyond academia, I find joy in soccer, the invigorating rush of running, and immersing myself in the captivating world of movies.

Let's connect and explore the realms of technology, and shared passions!
