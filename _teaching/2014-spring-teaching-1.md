I was appointed as a teaching assistant for the Information Retrieval and Web Search course offered by Dr. Vasile Rus. Throughout my tenure as TA, I conducted lectures on numerous topics outlined on the course website. I found great satisfaction in my role as TA, particularly in grading students' projects. Witnessing innovative solutions and elegant code was my favorite aspect. Moreover, I gleaned valuable insights from the students, contributing to my learning experience.
