I was appointed as teaching assistant for Information Retrieval and Web Search course offered by Dr. Vasile Rus. During my tenure as TA, I gave lectures on many topics as listed on the course website. I enjoyed my time as TA, Apart from giving lectures, my favroite part of being TA was grading students projects, I loved some innovative solutions and beautiful code. I learnt many things from students as well. You can find the course website [here](https://www.cs.memphis.edu/~vrus/teaching/ir-websearch/)
